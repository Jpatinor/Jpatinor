ðŸŽ“ UX Design Student | ðŸŽ¨ Creative Thinker | âœ¨ Always Curious

Hey there! Iâ€™m currently diving deep into the world of UX designâ€”learning how to make digital experiences more intuitive, accessible, and human. Outside of my studies, I enjoy creative hobbies like illustration, crafting, and anything that lets me bring ideas to life. Iâ€™m all about blending design thinking with a creative spark!
